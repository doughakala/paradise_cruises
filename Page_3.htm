<h1>The history of the Caribbean is rich with adventurous tales, blended cultures, and natural diversity. </h1>
<p>The impact of colonialism can still be seen in many of the island cultures today; so much so, in fact, that travelers often note a sense of living with the near-tangible history that permeates the region.<p>

<h2>Caribbean Indians</h2>

<p>The Taínos (which translates to "peace") began populating the region around a few hundred years B.C. European explorers noted separate Arawak tribes occupied several islands: the Borinquens were in Puerto Rico and the Lucayans inhabited the Bahamas, while other Taínos were on the islands of Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Cuba.</p>
<p>The Taínos slept in hammocks, held celebratory rituals and worshiped a male and a female god using icons called "zemis," which were stone and wood figurines. Their main food sources were the land and ocean: fish, parrots, manatee, doves, and small land animals provided sustenance along with crops like cassava and maize, and various wild fruits. They considered rain, wind, fire, and hurricanes their natural spiritual forces and believed the afterlife was in a place called "coyaba"--a hallowed land of dancing that was free of sickness, hurricanes, or hunger.</p>

<h2>Pirates</h2>

<p>Pirate ships pervaded the Caribbean coastline in the early 17th century. Some pirates made their homes on Hispaniola and adopted the cattle trade. They were called "buccaneers" because they cured the cattle meat in ovens called "boucans." These Brethren of the Coast, as they called themselves, lived in small clans and were seafaring misfits, ship deserters and former indentured servants. They wore loose-fitting clothes and slung knives around their waists. Their eventual home base was the island of Tortuga off the north coast of Haiti, overlooking the Windward Passage. From here they pirated the high seas, attacking vessels as far away as the Indian Ocean.</p>

<h2>Christopher Columbus</h2>

<p>Christopher Columbus' voyages, although sometimes controversial, certainly set the mark for New World exploration. After the fall of Constantinople, the previously safe routes to the Far East were sealed off, putting a tremendous hindrance on the ancient spice trade. There was an increased desire to explore the west and forge new routes that would reopen the spice trade. This was the motivation for Columbus' historic voyages to the west and he called the islands he stumbled upon the Indies because he thought he'd found the western passage to Asia and maintained such until his death in 1506.</p>
<p>For his inaugural trek, Columbus solicited funds from all the major European kings until King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain agreed to sponsor his travels to the western world. In 1492, he readied his vessels - the Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Maria--and set off with his crew from Palos. Columbus first spotted land on October 12, 1492. He christened this Bahamian island San Salvador. He would eventually touchdown in Cuba before crashing the Santa Maria off the coast of Hispaniola, known today as the Dominican Republic and Haiti. Columbus abandoned thirty-eight of his crew members on Hispaniola and returned to Spain where he proclaimed that he had reached Asia.</p>
<p>Columbus made his way to Trinidad in 1498, then returned to a tumultuous Hispaniola where he contended with island rebels. Despite being sent back to Spain in shackles, Columbus secured a fourth commission from the Spanish monarchy in 1502, but with the stipulation that he not return to Hispaniola. When he set sail this time, he discovered Central America's gold coffers. This journey ended, however, when he shipwrecked off the coast of Jamaica.</p>
<h2>Colonization and Independence</h2>
<p>Some islands changed hands more than twenty times during the Caribbean wars. European imperialists waged war among themselves and with the Carib Indians.
<p>Spanish explorers wiped out the Taíno as they plundered the Caribbean for gold in the 16th century. It wasn't until the Emancipation Act of 1834 and Europe no longer relied on the islands for sugar production that the Caribbean became less of a fighting prize; however, the lasting European influence on the history of the Caribbean can be seen by this colonization time line. Cuba and Puerto Rico were ceded to the United States in the late 19th century, and Cuba gained its independence in 1901, but independence for all the island nations wasn't a legitimate prospect until the 1960s. The French possessions remain departments of France; citizens of these islands have the same rights and privileges as citizens of Burgundy or Province. In 1962, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago became independent states within the British Commonwealth; Barbados did the same four years later. Next came independence for Antigua, Barbuda, Redonda, Anguilla, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and Dominica. Today, the islands continue to build on this self-reliance.</p>
